* How will the MC recruit from the MOB?
  - Maybe the MC is actually the leader of the MOB syndicate.  A kind
    of hidden figure that smaller crime lords MUST respect and even
    carry out orders for.  Perhaps the order to accompany the MC to
    War School is given as though from the larger crime syndicate.
  - An interesting way to tie the MC's Uncle dying is that he comes to
    find out that his Uncle has been the hidden leader of the MOBs.
    And the MC doesn't see how he could possibly do that job.  Since
    all of his life he's been taught to respect the plight of people,
    and crime seems to take advantage of the system and the week.
    Also he knows he lacks Grit, Cunning, and Brutality.
